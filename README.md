# Java-Comment-Generator
A simple, clean generator of opening comments for a java program. Includes Name, Date, and Program name. 
At least on Windows systems, this will obtain the Date, Take the programmer's name as a magic number(For convinience's sake),
and ask for the name of the program.
Features that I will be adding:
* Jcheckbox with options
* Simple name recognition
